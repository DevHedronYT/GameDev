# GameDev
My Open Source Public Game Development Projects. Any 3rd Party Assets used will be linked in the game's respective folder

Most of these projects can be found at: https://devhedronyt.itch.io

To get the repository you can either clone it or download the .zip file uploaded to itch.io here which is ~53 MB: 
https://devhedronyt.itch.io/game-dev-source-files 

Also, when I refer to or say, "Download the .zip file", I am talking about the .zip file of the repository which you can download or you can git clone it.
