# GameDev
My Open Source Public Game Development Projects. Any 3rd Party Assets used will be linked in the game's respective folder

Most of these projects can be found at: https://devhedronyt.itch.io

To get the repository you can either clone it or download the .zip file uploaded to Google Drive here which seems to be quite smaller than ~120 MB and is ~55 MB:  https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/15OhRg2EUaB7aZzzfHJLoRi3XY00ZG8ok

I will try to make an itch.io for downloading this repository to your computer since the original one is really big (120 MB) so I will insert a link for it too in some time

Edit:
	itch.io Link: https://devhedronyt.itch.io/game-dev-source-files 

Also, when I refer to or say, "Download the .zip file", I am talking about the .zip file of the repository which you can download or you can git clone it.
