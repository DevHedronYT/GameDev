# Afend

This game was made for the United-Game-Jam 2020, I am going to be continuing to make more open source games like these.
The .zip file contains everything except the exports. It was made with godot with my friends

I followed a lot of tutorials as this was just my 4th game I have ever made.
The tutorials I followed are here:
